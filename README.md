Node JS Learning

1. REPL :
   
   Read-Eval-Print Loop, which lets you interactively run JavaScript code in the terminal.   
   calculator.js -> run this file in terminal as node calculator.js

2. Modules :
   
   built-in modules -> (a). global module -> no need to import   
                       (b). non- global module -> need to import

   Streams : Streams are continuous flows of data that can be read or written piece by piece.

5. HTTP Module & Basic Server

   HTTP Module : HTTP module in Node.js is a built-in library used to create web servers that handle requests and send responses.

6. NPM & External Packages

   NPM (Node Package Manager) is the default tool that comes with Node.js.   
   External packages are prebuilt modules published by others (or you!) to solve common problems.   
   dependencies : Packages your app needs to run (even in production).   
   devDependencies : Packages used only during development, like testing, linting, etc.   

7. CLI Note Taking :

   Command Line Interface Note Taking with fs module   
   can performe operation like create, list, read, remove, update

8. Express.js :

   Express.js is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides robust tools for building web servers and APIs.
